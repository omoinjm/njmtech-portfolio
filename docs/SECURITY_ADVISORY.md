# Security Advisory

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Security Fixes Implemented (v0.5.1)

- CORS properly restricted from wildcard to environment-based origin
- Request validation on API endpoints
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint security rules enforced
- Input sanitization on form submissions

### ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Actions Required

**IMMEDIATE - Before deploying to production:**

1. **Rotate all exposed credentials** (exposure risk from committed .env file)
   - ❌ Database password: `Z8VkpMit4NPr` (COMPROMISED - rotate immediately)
   - ❌ Email app password: `lkhzdkuimyboccds` (COMPROMISED - rotate immediately)
   - ❌ Mailchimp URL: Contains user/list IDs (consider regenerating)

2. **Update Vercel environment variables**
   - Set all credentials in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure .env is NOT in git history
   - Use `git filter-branch` or BFG to clean git history if needed

3. **Implement email service**
   - Contact form currently returns success but doesn't send emails
   - Implement SendGrid or Mailgun integration
   - Use API keys instead of app passwords

### 📋 Known Limitations

#### Email Functionality
- **Status:** Implemented in API, not fully integrated
- **Risk Level:** Low (data is logged but not sent)
- **Fix:** Implement email service provider integration
- **Timeline:** Next 2-4 weeks

#### API Rate Limiting
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Risk Level:** Medium (potential abuse vector)
- **Fix:** Implement rate limiting middleware
- **Timeline:** Next 4-8 weeks

#### Monitoring & Logging
- **Status:** Basic logging implemented
- **Risk Level:** Medium (limited visibility into attacks)
- **Fix:** Integrate error tracking (Sentry) and analytics
- **Timeline:** Next 2-4 weeks

#### Database Access Control
- **Status:** Default PostgreSQL configuration
- **Risk Level:** Medium (depends on network security)
- **Fix:** Implement row-level security policies
- **Timeline:** Next 4-8 weeks

## Security Best Practices by Component

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Environment-based origin restriction
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ❌ No user authentication system (portfolio)
- ❌ No role-based access control

### API Security
- ✅ Input validation on contact form
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ⚠️ Rate limiting not implemented
- ⚠️ API logging in development mode only

### Database Security
- ✅ Using Cloudflare D1 (managed database)
- ✅ HTTPS API access required
- ⚠️ Access is mediated through the Cloudflare API token
- ⚠️ No row-level security implemented

### Dependency Security
- ✅ Using npm audit regularly
- ✅ Dependencies kept updated
- ✅ Known vulnerabilities tracked
- ⚠️ No automated dependency updates

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Using Vercel (managed hosting)
- ✅ HTTPS enforced
- ✅ Environment variables protected
- ⚠️ Docker image uses Node.js LTS (good base)

## Testing Security

### How to Test Security

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit --production
   ```

2. **Type Safety**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Code Quality**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Security Testing Tools

- **npm audit** - Dependency scanning
- **Snyk** - Dependency monitoring
- **OWASP ZAP** - Web app scanning
- **TypeScript** - Type-based vulnerability prevention

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Issue

1. **Report privately** using SECURITY.md instructions
2. **Do not disclose publicly** until fix is available
3. **Include detailed information** about the issue
4. **Provide proof of concept** if possible

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledge** (24-48 hours)
2. **Investigate** (3-7 days)
3. **Develop Fix** (7-30 days depending on severity)
4. **Test Fix** (3-7 days)
5. **Release Patch** (immediately for critical)
6. **Post Advisory** (within 30 days of fix)
