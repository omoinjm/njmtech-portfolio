              <p>
                As an experienced software engineer, I specialize in web
                development and have a passion for continuous learning and
                improvement. My interest in software engineering began at a
                young age, as I was consistently curious about understanding the
                intricacies of how things work.

                In high school, I tutored a Computer Applications Technology
                class as part of my extracurricular activities. Since then, I
                have continued to pursue my passion for software engineering
                through self-studying, side projects, university courses,
                industry certifications, and work experience.

                My career began as a web developer for a South African modeling
                agency, where I gained experience in creating high-quality web
                applications. I then worked as a developer for a start-up social
                networking company, where I contributed to the development of
                innovative web features. Most recently, I have worked as a
                Junior Software Engineer at{" "}

                I am committed to continuous self-improvement and sharing my
                knowledge and experiences with others. For example, I have
                developed this portfolio website where I showcase my development
                skills and provide resources for other aspiring software
                engineers. Through my dedication to learning and teaching, I
                have become proficient in a variety of programming languages,
                frameworks, and tools.
